        Trade settlement is the process by which securities (like stocks or bonds) are transferred from the seller to the buyer, and cash is transferred from the buyer to the seller, finalizing a trade. In this project we look to reduce the time for a settlement in the US Market from T+1 to T+0,which could significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of U.S. financial markets using Agentic AI, LLMs and DLT.
