<table><tr><th colspan="5"><b>WHAT : Trade settlement is the process by which securities (like stocks or bonds) are transferred from the seller to the buyer, and cash is transferred from the buyer to the seller, finalizing a trade. In this project we look to reduce the time for a settlement in the US Market from T+1 to T+0 using Agentic AI, LLMs and DLT</b></th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5"><b>WHY : The longer the transaction takes to complete, the more it is exposed to risks and it is more likely to fail. The buying party may not have enough funds to complete the trade, or the seller might not have enough stocks to sell, even though previously agreed upon. To reduce this risk we look to reduce the time a trade takes to settle from T+1 to T+0. Not only does this reduce risk, but also creates many new opportunities in the market such as a 24 hour trading window, allowing customers to redeploy their assets quickly.</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5"><b>EXISTING WORKS: JPMorgan’s Kinexys for tokenized payments and assets, Fnality’s central bank-backed atomic payment system, and DTCC’s Project Ion, a DLT-powered parallel settlement platform for U.S. equities.</b></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5"><b>HOW: We choose a DLT based system with IBFT-2 consensus, such that majority parties agree before a trade is finalized. We use Agentic AI for pre-trade validation, risk checks and blacklisting brokers or dealers.  Then in order to add explainability we integrate LLMs in our system, which explains the conditions for the trade, summarizes details and explains the possible cause if any trade is rejected</b> </td></tr>
